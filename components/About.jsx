            I am a web developer, who has worked on over 40 different websites.
            I studied web development for 4 years and have worked with startups
            to build their web presence over the past 2 years. I am well
            adversant in html, css and javascript and very Good in react and
            node Express. Other than websites i am Good in web scrapping with
            python and also have done some sample personal projects.
          </p>

            Fascinated by how powerful programming can be, I was drawn to learn
            more. I began learning javascript and became even more excited about
            making websites interactive. I then began freelance work with
            Upwork. I&apos;m currently working on projects with React JS, Next JS,
            Firebase, and learning new technologies.
